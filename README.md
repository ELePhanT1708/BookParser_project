# BookParser_project

Project for parsing roslit.ru for downloading all pictures, names , descriptions and characters about book which matched with needed xls table . 
Matching with names and other characters to find right one and parse all data about this book with pictures from roslit.ru
This repository doesn't have the result folder with all data and pictures. 
Most of all hardcoded but working .

Most of all situations I used bs4 for parsing web-sites, A lot of data . 

In result, I downloaded about 4 thousands of book entities with author , description and other charasteristics . All entities was saved as dict in txt file. 

Maybe will be useful for me and you in the future  ))
